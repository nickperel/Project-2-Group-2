  ## Description
  
  * Upon loading up the website, you are presented with a button that floats up from the bottom of the screen that says "Enter If You Dare!", and once clicked, it will bring the user to the homepage of the app. Once on the homepage, the user is presented with a choice of five brands to choose from, which are Jordan, Nike, Adidas, New Balance, and Asics. Once a brand name is clicked, the user is then directed to a page that lists all of the available sneakers that fall underneath the respective brand name that they clicked. Then, if the user would like a bit more information on a specific shoe, they can click the title of the shoe that is displayed in red. After clicking on the shoe title, the user is brought to another page that displays the image of the desired shoe, its price, the amount that the website has in stock available for purchase, the type of shoe it is, which can be either basketball, running, or lifestyle, as well as a list of the shoe's attributes that are displayed as tags at the bottom. Following this pattern, the user should be able to browse Sneaker Sniper's entire selection of shoes from all brands as they wish. They also have the ability to sign up for an account, or log in if they already have an existing account.
